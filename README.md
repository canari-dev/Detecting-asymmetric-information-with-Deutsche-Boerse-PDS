# Context :

My goal is to detect instances of asymmetrical information in the stock options market.

Asymmetrical information can stem from criminal behaviours like insider trading but also from an edge given by advanced research to actors deploying extensive means like the use of mobile phone data, private polls or other types of intelligence gathering along with machine learning treatment of those data.
The development of those techniques risks undermining the business model of less specialized actors, including market makers, thus jeopardizing the structure of the market.

Asymmetrical information can be detected in restrospect because they will ultimately lead to a dramatic shift of a parameter such as the spot price, the volatility or the dividend yield.

The goal here is to identify signals in the trading pattern that will alert liquidity providers that something is fishy.


# Detecting-asymmetric-information-with-dbg-pds

Building on the dbg-pds-option-calibration git which is itself based on the Deutsche Boerse Public Data project (https://github.com/Deutsche-Boerse/dbg-pds), I am now using the output data to detect instances of asymmetric information.


# The BuildInputs class is just here to transform the parameters dataframes generated in the dbg-pds-option-calibration git into time series.Â 

In the dbg-pds-option-calibration git, set of parameters was generated each time a batch of 5 trades could be used to calibrate a set of implicit volatility parameters for any given maturity.
This leads to a time series that is unevenly sampled. Thanks to some extrapolation (1 day max) the BuildInputs class transforms these data into a proper time series of parameters sampled to 1 minute intervals.

Separately, we also compute time series deriving from the actual trades (the sames that we used to calibrate the vols parameters).
Trades are converted into sensitivity. For example : vega = Qty * quotity * vega of the option
The vega of the option is given by a pricing using the Pricing class (same used for the calibration)

Going further still, these sensitivities are "signed" in order to (try to) signify if it was a buying or selling interest. The disputable hypothesis here is that if the parameter is going up, then it means that trades happening at this time are responsible for this trend (since trades are what is used to do the calibration) so these trades must be buying the sensitivity (vega or other). 

Once merged into the df_pivot dataframe, those inputs will be used to compute the actual X and Y for our machine learning project.

The idea here is to later associate (through supervised Machine Learning) a significant pattern on one parameter to a later surge in the associated parameter : This will happen if someone had the information leading to this surge before the rest of market participants and tried to take advantage of this knowledge.


# The BuildXY class aims to convert those time series into "stationary" ones.

The idea here is that we are trying to detect a trading pattern that may be common to all instances of asymmetric information. We need to iron out everything that is specific to a certain period or stock, along with false positives, in order to get clean data. Here are the steps taken :

Here are the steps taken :

1/ Look at forward parameters :
This cleans out any punctual event like a dividend ex date that will inevitably prompt a jump in the spot/forward ratio but not in a "forward - spot/forward ratio" which is computed as the ratio of two spot/forward ratio on different maturities (typically a long term one divided by the nearby).
Similarly, when a company publishes its earnings report, the implicit vol will collapse but the forward vol will be mostly unaffected on average, which is what we want. This is what the differentiate_matu function does.

2/ Short term trend divided by long term trend :
This simply uses exponentially weighted moving average in order to detect short term variation of volume/level from a long term average.
This is done by the differentiate_time function. This is also where the Y series is generated : it simply consist in observing parameters variation over the 5 days following the date at which we oberve the Xs.

3/ For each single stock underlying (here only DAI), we divide its time-series by the corresponding time series of the euro stoxx 50 index :
This will iron out market regimes.


# Finally, a very simple Dense Neural Network with Keras will show that those inputs are by no means sufficient to detect a pattern that would annonce a later sudden shift of parameters.

Cases of sudden move of a parameter (here 3 standard deviations) are rare and only a fraction of those events would have been preceded by abnormal trading patterns due to well informed agents trying to take advantage. 
As a consequence, there is not enough data to feed a complex Neural Network. If we were to use a complex NN, we would probably run into over-parameterization issues.

The reason why the Xs thus generated are insuficient (see yellow graphs in the output folder) is likely due to weak inputs. In particular, the hypothesis made to get signed sensitivity (depending on the side of the interest generating the trade) is dubious and we would need bid-offer prices prior to the trade in order to get a better idea of which side was the interest.
